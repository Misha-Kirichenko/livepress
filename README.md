## üì∞ About

A platform for publishing articles with categorized content, user/admin roles, and real-time features.

Users can subscribe to categories and receive **live notifications** when new articles are published or commented. Admins are notified of **reactions** and **comments** on their articles. The system is designed for responsiveness, scalability, and robust role-based access.

## üóÑÔ∏è Backend Features

### üîê Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based login and session management
- Role-based access: `USER`, `ADMIN`
- Middleware-protected routes
- Blocked users are denied access via Redis-first check with DB fallback

### üì¶ Database & Structure
- Sequelize migrations & seeders for:
  - Users, Articles, Comments, Reactions (likes/dislikes)
  - UserCategory subscriptions
- Pagination and filtering for articles by title, category, and keywords

### ‚úçÔ∏è Article Interaction
- Users can:
  - Like/dislike articles (toggle)
  - Comment on articles
  - Subscribe/unsubscribe to categories
- Admins can:
  - Create/edit/delete articles
  - Upload images via `multer`
  - Block/unblock users
  - Remove user comments
- All article creation and editing routes use **strict validation** rules via `express-validator`

### Real-Time Functionality (Socket.IO)

#### üîÅ Live UI Updates
- When a user adds, edits, or deletes a **comment**, all users on the article page receive instant updates via sockets
- This ensures a reactive and collaborative experience

#### üîî Notifications

##### For Users:
- Real-time notifications for:
  - New articles in subscribed categories
  - Comments on articles from those categories

##### For Admins:
- Real-time notifications for:
  - Reactions (like/dislike) on their articles
  - New comments on their articles

- All notifications are stored in **Redis** (with fallback safety if Redis is unavailable)
- UI receives notifications via **Socket.IO**

### üö´ Blocking & Consistency
- Admins can block users (status stored in both Redis and DB)
- Middleware checks user status via Redis, and falls back to DB
- Implements **eventual consistency** between Redis and DB
- Scheduled `cron` job periodically synchronizes blocked user data

### üß© Architecture Overview

The project follows a **modular, layered architecture** with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Routes / Controllers**  
  Handle HTTP requests and responses. Controllers apply middleware (e.g., auth, validation) and delegate business logic to service layers, keeping themselves thin and focused on orchestration.

- **Middlewares**  
  Responsible for:
  - JWT authentication and role-based access control  
  - Blocked user verification using Redis with graceful fallback to the database  
  - Data validation via `express-validator` for article creation/editing and other user input

- **Services**  
  Contain core business logic, including:
  - Database operations (PostgreSQL via Sequelize)
  - Redis interactions for notifications and user state
  - Triggering socket events for live UI updates

- **Socket Gateways & Handlers**  
  Modular real-time communication is organized into namespaces:
  - `/article-interactions`
  - `/user-notifications`
  - `/admin-notifications`  
  Each namespace has its own access control middleware and event handlers. Events like comment creation, deletion, or reaction toggles are processed in isolated handlers inside the `sockets/handlers` layer.

- **Socket Connection Management**  
  Active socket connections are tracked in-memory using `Map`, grouped by namespace and user nickname. This allows efficient broadcasting and socket management within `services/sockets`.

- **Redis as Notification Storage**  
  Redis is the **primary data store for notifications**, allowing fast access and live delivery through socket events. Notifications are stored as Redis hashes and not duplicated in the database ‚Äî which is acceptable given their ephemeral nature.

- **Fallback & Fault-Tolerance**  
  For blocked users, Redis is used as the primary store, with **eventual consistency ensured** via:
  - Fallback to the database in case Redis is unavailable  
  - Periodic synchronization between Redis and DB using scheduled `cron` jobs

### üß© Architecture Overview (Frontend)

The frontend follows a **feature-based modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

- **`api/`**  
  Service layer for HTTP requests (`authService`, `articleService`, etc.)

- **`hooks/`**  
  Custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and socket integration

- **`contexts/`**  
  Global app state using Context API:
  - `AuthContext` (auth state)
  - `CategoriesContext` (subscriptions)
  - `SnackbarProvider` (UI feedback)

- **`handlers/`**  
  Handle real-time socket events separately from UI logic

- **`components/`**  
  Reusable UI components adhering to single-responsibility principle

- **`pages/`**  
  Route-level views: `Main`, `Login`, `Article`, `CreateArticle`, etc.

- **`HOC/`**  
  High-order components like `WithAuth` to protect routes
